 # E-Campus WebSite

The idea is to create a **StackOverflow** clone with added functionality of MCQ assignments. The app is supposed to be used by teachers and students. There can be discussions created students by asking questions and other students and teachers can also answer the questions. Teachers can have MCQ based assignments.
